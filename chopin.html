    <p id="short biography">Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849) was a Polish-French composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era. A child prodigy, he began composing early and gave public performances by age seven. He left Poland at 20 and settled in Paris, where he spent the rest of his life. Deeply patriotic, Chopin expressed his love for Poland through music. He wrote almost exclusively for solo piano, creating technically brilliant and emotionally rich works like mazurkas, nocturnes, and polonaises. Despite chronic illness, likely tuberculosis, he composed some of his greatest music in Paris before dying at age 39. His influence on piano music remains profound.</p>
